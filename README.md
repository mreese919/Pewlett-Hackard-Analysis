## To Summerize

Pewlett-Hackard will have over 90,000 soon-to-be retirees and it would be very benefital to the company to have those that are eligble for the mentorship program
to help train and pass on their years of knowledge to those that would need to fill their vacancies. Addition queries could be made to how many employees will be
retiring anually. This will also help us breakdown from which departments the company will need to hire to fill those upcoming vacancies. If those vacancies actually
need filling.
